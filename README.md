# artic-mn
artic-mn is a nextflow workflow for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data generated on [Oxford Nanopore sequencers](https://nanoporetech.com/products) using libraries created with protocols based on the [ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019).

This workflow started as a streamlined version of the [monroe ont_assembly workflow](https://github.com/StaPH-B/staphb_toolkit/blob/main/staphb_toolkit/workflows/monroe/monroe_ont_assembly.nf) created for the StaPH-B Toolkit by [Kelsey Florek](https://github.com/k-florek), [Abigail Shockey](https://github.com/AbigailShockey), and others. Considerable flexibility and functionality has been removed to adapt the workflow to the needs of our lab. If you are here because you need a COVID sequencing workflow consider using any one of the many workflows built into the [StaPH-B Toolkit](https://github.com/StaPH-B/staphb_toolkit).
